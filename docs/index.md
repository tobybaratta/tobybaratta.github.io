# Hi, I'm Toby Baratta

I'm a researcher, technologist, and organizer working in moderation, trust & safety, and human-computer interaction. My work focuses on building better systems for communities online — ones that are thoughtful, transparent, and actually work for people.

A few current projects and updates:

- I'm a Teaching Assistant for Games & Society at the University of California, Irvine.
- I’ll be speaking at the **All Things in Moderation** conference in May 2025.
- I’m writing a book review for the **International Journal of Communication**.
- I just got back from the **CRA-IDEALS** conference at the beginning of April 2025.
- I recently was the Technical Director for **Battle of BC 7**, a major fighting game tournament in Vancouver, Canada. (I was the voice in the commentators' ears.)

I live in Irvine with my two cats, **Alfie** and **Lucy**. In my spare time, I play a lot of video games — I’m currently playing _Metaphor: Refantasio_.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore, read, or reach out.
