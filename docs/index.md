# Hi, I'm Toby

Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of California, Irvine, where I study how grassroots online communities self-govern. I'm particularly focused around gaming communities and metagovernance, moderation best practices, and conduct enforcement.

I live in Irvine, California with my two cats, **Alfie** and **Lucy**. In my spare time, I like video games, side projects, and reading. Also reddit. Probably too much reddit.

[Here's what I'm up to now](./now.md) and [here's my CV](./cv.md).

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore, read, or reach out! ^.^
